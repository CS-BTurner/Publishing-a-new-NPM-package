## Configuring package.json

There are a couple of important fields that need to be configured for best end user experience:

### Name

To publish to NPM as a private CloudSense package. You will need to prepend the package name with `@cloudsense/`.

```json
{ "name": "@cloudsense/<package name>" }
```

### Description

The description field is what is shown in the search results when querying for your package. It is important to put something here so user's can quickly identify if this is the correct package for them.

```json
{ "description": "A meaningful and short description" }
```

### Main

Obviously quite important. This is what user's will download when installing the package. This file should only export what is necessary to prevent package bloat.

```json
{ "main": "dist/index.js" }
```

### Types

For Typescript projects; this should point to the `index.d.ts` file. This can be generated by your tsconfig by setting the property `declaration` to `true`.

```json
{ "types": "dist/index.d.ts" }
```

### Files

What files to actually include in the package. Refer to [NPM's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files) on what is included or excluded by default. **This is very important to get right**. Luckily you can test and see the contents of what will be uploaded by using the command `npm publish --dry-run`.

```json
{ "files": ["dist/**/*"] }
```

### Author

If you write a package, **be proud**. Put your name here.

```json
{ "author": "John Smith <john.smith@cloudsense.com>" }
```

### Contributors

If you're helping maintain a package, **be proud**. Put your name here.

```json
{ "contributors": ["John Smith <john.smith@cloudsense.com>"] }
```

### Repository

By having this field populated, NPM will show this when displaying the package's README file. As such it makes it significantly easier for users to identify what repository is being used. _Hopefully so they can contribute to it..._

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "tools.cloudsenseltd.com:/mnt/ebs2/tools/git/<repo name>"
  }
}
```

### Keywords

The keywords property is a list of tags that can be associated to a given package. Putting something here will make your package easier to find by searching using a given keyword.

```json
{ "keywords": ["<comma seperated list of keywords here>"] }
```

### Example package.json

```json
{
  "name": "@cloudsense/<package name>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "<description>",

  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": ["dist/**/*"],

  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build"
  },

  "author": "John Smith <john.smith@cloudsense.com>",
  "license": "CloudSense",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "tools.cloudsenseltd.com:/mnt/ebs2/tools/git/<repo name>"
  },

  "keywords": ["typescript", "utility"],
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "@cloudsense/eslint-config/ts"
  }
}
```
