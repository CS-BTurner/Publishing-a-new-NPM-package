## README

Every package regardless of its current functional state, should have a README markdown file at the root of the project. This is the file that NPM displays when you search for a package and is really the starting point for users to get started using your package.

**Simple house rules. No README, No package**.

No really - even if it is only a beta / proof of concept it should still have a basic README.

### Good Structure

Since the README is the starting point for using your package it should have well written detailed documentation on how to initially get started. As well as some of the more powerful features that you are able to use within the package. This is up to personal preference but I would strongly suggest the following:

```md
# Title

Short description

## Installation

## Getting started

## API

## Contributing

## Changelog
```
