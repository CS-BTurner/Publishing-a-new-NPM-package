## JSDoc

For all exported classes, methods or functions - JSDoc should be implemented to add contextual information on what the class, method or function is doing. **This includes for Typescript projects**. Done right, this adds a level of sophistication to our packages that significantly improves developer experience.

Refer to [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for detailed usage guide.
